## Description

### 1. Project summary:

The Pharmacy Website is a comprehensive web application designed for both pharmacists and customers. This website provides a user-friendly interface for users to explore, order medications, view available pharmaceutical products, and access detailed information about various drugs and their uses. Whether you're a customer seeking medical supplies or a pharmacist looking to streamline your services, this website is your ultimate platform for efficient pharmaceutical management and access.

### 2. Technologies used:

- **React**: This project uses React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to create complex UIs from small, reusable pieces of code. It also provides a virtual DOM to optimize rendering and improve app performance.

- **Node.js and Express**: The backend of this project is built with Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows for server-side scripting. Express, a web application framework for Node.js, is used to build the web server and handle HTTP requests.

- **MongoDB and Mongoose**: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used to store data in a flexible, JSON-like format. Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.

- **JWT for Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. In this project, JWT is used for handling user authentication and protecting routes.

- **Bootstrap and CSS**: Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, is used for designing responsive and mobile-first web pages. Custom CSS is also used for additional styling and layout design.

- **Material-UI (MUI)**: This project uses Material-UI, a popular React UI framework that implements Google's Material Design. It provides a set of pre-built React components that follow the best practices of user interface design. With MUI, you can build robust, consistent, and beautiful user interfaces with less effort.
